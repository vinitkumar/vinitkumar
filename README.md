### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Staff Engineer at Socialschools Websites Team and a core developer for Django CMS. I have a lot of experience working with different programming languages and databases, including Python, C, Go, Node.js/JavaScript, Postgres, Redis, SQLite, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, and ElasticSearch. I also have experience deploying to various cloud platforms, such as AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, and Heroku. In addition to my work at Socialschools, I also write and maintain some useful open-source software.
