# Hi there 👋

## Welcome to my Github

I'm a **Principal Engineer at [Scalefusion](https://scalefusion.com)** and a **[Django CMS Fellow](https://www.django-cms.org/en/blog/2024/11/07/welcoming-vinit-kumar-as-the-newest-django-cms-fellow/)**, passionate about solving complex problems and building impactful technology.

With over **12 years of experience** (since February 2013), I specialize in **Django, Python, Go, and TypeScript**, architecting scalable systems and leading high-performing engineering teams.

### 🚀 Current Role — Principal Engineer at Scalefusion

At [Scalefusion](https://scalefusion.com), I lead engineering initiatives that power our **Device Management Platform**, enabling organizations to manage fleets of devices securely and at scale.

One of my primary contributions is designing and developing **Scalefusion Live Terminal** — a real-time remote terminal / command execution system for multiple OS platforms. IT admins can remotely access Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS devices via the dashboard.

- The official documentation for remote terminal on macOS can be found [here](https://help.scalefusion.com/v1/docs/remotely-access-live-terminal-on-macos-devices).  [oai_citation:1‡Scalefusion Help](https://help.scalefusion.com/v1/docs/remotely-access-live-terminal-on-macos-devices)  

This solution is built for **security**, **low latency**, **scalability**, and **reliability** across large fleets. I also mentor and guide teams on system design, performance optimization, and backend architecture.
