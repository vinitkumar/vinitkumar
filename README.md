## What I Do

I architect and ship backend systems that handle millions of requests daily. I lead teams to design databases that don't break at scale, optimize APIs that serve billions of queries, and build platforms that power real businesses. At the same time, I maintain production-grade open-source projects used by thousands of developers worldwide.
