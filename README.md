# Hi there üëã

I'm a **Principal Engineer** at [Scalefusion](https://scalefusion.com) and [Django CMS Fellow](https://www.django-cms.org/en/blog/2024/11/07/welcoming-vinit-kumar-as-the-newest-django-cms-fellow/) passionate about solving meaningful problems and pushing tech boundaries. I love reading, listening/playing music, appreciating/making art, and enjoying a good cup of coffee.

I have **12 years** of experience (since February 1, 2013) specializing in Django, Python, Go, and TypeScript. I have successfully built and delivered exceptional products and services throughout my career. Notably, I have led the architecture and development of a [cutting-edge Multi-tenant CMS](https://www.divio.com/case-studies/social-schools-divio-transformation/), catering to an extensive network of over 3k websites. This robust CMS is designed to handle a substantial volume of multi-million monthly requests with efficiency and scalability at its core.

In addition to my backend expertise with Python, Django, and Go, I possess extensive frontend proficiency, including 7 years of React experience and over a decade of mastery in JavaScript, TypeScript, and related technologies. This comprehensive skill set enables me to seamlessly navigate complex codebases while collaborating effectively with diverse stakeholders.

I excel in optimizing performance and enhancing the security of services, consistently delivering top-tier results. As a [Core Developer at DjangoCMS](https://github.com/orgs/django-cms/teams/core-team), the industry's most popular Django-based CMS, I have gained invaluable insights and refined my expertise in line with industry best practices.

I am also invited as an [Individual Member](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/individual-members/) with Django Software Foundation.

Moreover, I am well-versed in various cloud platforms, such as AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean, and Azure. Leveraging these powerful platforms, I am adept at deploying and managing robust, scalable solutions that meet the highest standards of performance and reliability.

In my role as a Staff Software Engineer and Team Leader, I have demonstrated my ability to lead high-performing teams effectively. By fostering a culture of innovation and excellence, I have successfully steered projects toward success, consistently meeting and exceeding expectations.

I am deeply passionate about driving innovation and delivering exceptional outcomes in every project I undertake. My proven track record and my unwavering commitment to excellence make me an ideal candidate for leading and contributing to high-performing teams.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, spending time with my family, and contributing to open source projects. My wife, [Rituparna Dey](https://rituparnadey.com), is the founder of [ScoopHubs.com](https://scoophubs.com), a digital marketing company.

## What I'm Doing Now

Right now, I'm focused on building robust system-level features at [Scalefusion](https://scalefusion.com), including a live terminal interface over SSH. I'm also actively mentoring contributors and shaping the future roadmap as a [Django CMS Fellow](https://www.django-cms.org/en/blog/2024/11/07/welcoming-vinit-kumar-as-the-newest-django-cms-fellow/).

Mornings are for the gym üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, evenings for OSS work, and weekends for deep thinking and family time. I'm also working on tightening my focus and building long-term rituals around reading and creating.

Some current interests: Go internals, OS-level programming, high-performance networking, and managing cognitive load as a Principal Engineer.
